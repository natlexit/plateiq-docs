## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By downloading, installing, or using the **PlateIQ** mobile application (the "App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the App.

We may modify these Terms at any time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Terms on this page. Your continued use of the App after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.

## 2. Medical Disclaimer (Important)

**PlateIQ is NOT a medical organization and its staff cannot give you medical advice or diagnosis.**

* **Information Purpose Only:** All information provided by the App (including calorie counts, macro calculations, and weight loss estimates) is for informational and educational purposes only.
* **Consult a Doctor:** You should consult with a physician before starting any diet or fitness program. You should strictly follow your doctor's advice.
* **No Liability:** We are not responsible for any health problems that may result from training programs, consultations, products, or events you learn about through the App. If you engage in any exercise program you receive through this App, you agree that you do so at your own risk and are voluntarily participating in these activities.

## 3. User Accounts

To use certain features of the App, you must register for an account. You agree to:
* Provide accurate, current, and complete information.
* Maintain the security of your password and accept all risks of unauthorized access to your account.
* Notify us immediately if you discover or suspect any security breaches.

We reserve the right to disable any user account at any time if, in our sole opinion, you have failed to comply with any of the provisions of these Terms.

## 4. Subscriptions and Payments

* **Payment Processor:** Payments are processed through **Stripe**. We do not store your full credit card information.
* **Auto-Renewal:** Your subscription will automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle (monthly or annually) unless you cancel it at least 24 hours before the expiry date.
* **Cancellation:** You can cancel your subscription at any time in the App settings. The cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the free service.
* **Refunds:** Except when required by law, paid subscription fees are non-refundable. Certain refund requests for subscriptions may be considered by the Company on a case-by-case basis.

## 5. Prohibited Conduct

You agree not to:
* Use the App for any illegal purpose.
* Upload content that is offensive, illegal, or violates the rights of others.
* Attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, or hack the App.
* Use the App in any way that could interfere with, disrupt, negatively affect, or inhibit other users from fully enjoying the App.

## 6. Intellectual Property

The App and its original content (features and functionality) are and will remain the exclusive property of PlateIQ and its licensors. The App is protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the United States and foreign countries.

## 7. Limitation of Liability

In no event shall PlateIQ, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from:
* Your access to or use of or inability to access or use the App;
* Any conduct or content of any third party on the App;
* Any content obtained from the App; and
* Unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your transmissions or content.

## 8. Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the **State of Delaware, United States**, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

**International Use:**
We make no representation that the App is appropriate or available for use in your specific location. Those who access or use the App from other jurisdictions (including the European Union and Russia) do so at their own volition and are responsible for compliance with local law.
